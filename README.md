## How I Ensure Quality Control
I employ many different techniques to ensure my code is functional and secure, implementing comprehensive unit testing with JUnit playing a crucial role. JUnit tests allow for the automation 
of testing individual units of source code, ensuring that each component behaves as intended. Security can be enhanced by incorporating tests that simulate potential attack vectors or misuse
cases, validating input sanitation, and enforcing good coding practices.

## How I Interpret User Needs Into Programs
Interpreting user needs in a program requires active communication with stakeholders and potential users, understanding the problem domain deeply, and translating these requirements into 
testable specifications. Based on research, utilizing behavior-driven development frameworks alongside JUnit, like Cucumber, can help bridge the gap between technical specifications and human-
readable descriptions of software behavior. 

## My Approach to Designing Software
I approach designing software with importance upon a clear understanding of the problem and user requirements, followed by an iterative process of design, implementation, and testing.
Employing test-driven development with JUnit encourages the design of testable, modular, and maintainable code. This involves writing tests before the code itself, guiding the software
design in a way that supports robustness and flexibility.
